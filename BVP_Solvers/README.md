## Programs used to solve two different ODEs ##

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Numerical_Schemes.py program contains a variety of the discrete time-stepping ODE solver methods use in both the problem 1 and problem 1 driver programs.

To plot	all results for the 1st problem, run the program: am213b_hw1_p1.py

To plot	all results for the 2nd problem, run the program: am213b_hw1_p2.py
